#backyard

Easy backend framework for whatever backend purposes that you want.

This is early alpha, use at your own risk.

Still under heavy development.

Built with REST in mind.

Will inherit approaches from EmeraldBox.

unix/linux support only for now (maybe windows in the future, remember it's MAYBE)

#installing

for usage info run ./yard help
